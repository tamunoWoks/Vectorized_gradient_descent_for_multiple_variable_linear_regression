## Vectorized Gradient Descent for Multiple Variable Linear Regression
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of gradient descent for multiple variable linear regression using vectorized operations in Python. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing gradient descent, a fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning.
### Overview
This notebook focuses on solving a linear regression problem with multiple features using gradient descent. It demonstrates how to:
- Implement vectorized operations for efficient computation.
- Compute the cost function (mean squared error).
- Calculate gradients for model parameters (weights and bias).
- Perform gradient descent to optimize the model.
- Visualize the convergence of the algorithm.  

The notebook is designed for educational purposes, and is suitable for beginners, and anyone interested in understanding the fundamentals of gradient descent and linear regression.
### Notebook Structure
The notebook is organized into the following sections:
- **Libraries:** Imports necessary Python libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and custom styles for plotting.
- **Data Preparation:** Defines the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`) for a linear regression problem with multiple features.
- **Model Initialization:** Initializes the model parameters (weights `w` and bias `b`).
- **Prediction Functions:**
    - Implements an element-wise prediction function (`predict_single_loop`).
    - Implements a vectorized prediction function (`predict`) for efficient computation.
- **Cost Function:** Computes the cost (mean squared error) for the linear regression model.
- **Gradient Calculation:** Calculates the gradients for the weights and bias using vectorized operations.
- **Gradient Descent:** Performs gradient descent to optimize the model parameters and minimize the cost function.
- **Visualization:** Plots the cost versus iteration to monitor the convergence of the algorithm.
- **Observations:** Discusses the results and potential improvements.
### Key Concepts

- Gradient Descent
- Vectorization
- Cost/Loss Function
### Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`: For numerical computations and vectorized operations.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualization.
- `math`: For mathematical operations.
### Results and Observations
- he notebook demonstrates the implementation of gradient descent for linear regression with multiple variables.
- The cost function decreases over iterations, indicating that the algorithm is converging.
- However, the predictions are not highly accurate, suggesting that further tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of iterations) or feature scaling may be required.
### Future Improvements
- **Feature Scaling:**
    - Normalize or standardize the input features to improve the performance of gradient descent.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    - Experiment with different learning rates (Î±) and numbers of iterations to achieve better convergence.
- **Advanced Optimization Algorithms:**
    - Implement more advanced optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.
- **Regularization:**
    - Add regularization terms (e.g., L1 or L2) to prevent overfitting.
- **Real-World Dataset:**
    - Apply the algorithm to a real-world dataset to evaluate its performance in a practical scenario.
