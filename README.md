## Vectorized Gradient Descent for Multiple Variable Linear Regression
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of gradient descent for multiple variable linear regression using vectorized operations in Python. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing gradient descent, a fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning.
#### Overview
This notebook focuses on solving a linear regression problem with multiple features using gradient descent. It demonstrates how to:
- Implement vectorized operations for efficient computation.
- Compute the cost function (mean squared error).
- Calculate gradients for model parameters (weights and bias).
- Perform gradient descent to optimize the model.
- Visualize the convergence of the algorithm.  

The notebook is designed for educational purposes, and is suitable for beginners, and anyone interested in understanding the fundamentals of gradient descent and linear regression.
