## Multiple Variable Linear Regression
In this project, we will implement the data structures and routines to support linear regression for multiple features.
#### Goals
- Extend our regression model routines to support multiple features
    - Extend data structures to support multiple features
    - Rewrite prediction, cost and gradient routines to support multiple features
    - Utilize NumPy np.dot to vectorize their implementations for speed and simplicity
